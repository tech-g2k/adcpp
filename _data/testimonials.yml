  description: I understood that majority of people dislike having their teeth touched, and numbed by injection. I wouldn’t say that being my patient, everything is painless. However, through my focus toward my patient’s comforts, I would pay extra attention not only to the result of every treatments, but also gentleness that I would do to minimize your discomforts during dental treatments.  My ambition as a dentist is to eliminate pain & diseases in oral cavity, provide comfort, restore a healthier smile that would improve quality of life for patients.  God bless
